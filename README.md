# Omniscient
Omnisient is an AI tool that offers the potential to improve daily cognition by analyzing speech patterns and offering insights into an individualâ€™s cognitive state.

## Overview
Omniscient works through several layers:
    Takes in input from user collected audio data. The founder of Omnisient uses a Rode wireless mic 2 to collect all audio data though the day. 
    - The data is then uploaded into Omnicient
    - Omnisient uses OpenAI's open sourced transcripion model "Whisper" to transcribe all the audio data from the file.
