Omniscient is an AI tool designed to enhance daily cognition through speech pattern analysis, providing insights into an individual's cognitive state.

## Overview

Omniscient processes data through several layers:

1. **Audio Data Collection**: Uses a Rode Wireless Mic 2 to collect audio data throughout the day.
2. **Data Upload**: Audio data is uploaded to the Omniscient platform.
3. **Transcription**: Utilizes OpenAI's open-sourced transcription model, "Whisper", to convert audio to text.
4. **Speaker Diarization**: Employs Pyannote's audio model to distinguish speakers. The primary user must speak first in the recording for accurate identification.
5. **Data Synchronization and Labeling**: Syncs and labels the transcription and diarization data to maintain context and speaker identity.
6. **Cognitive Analysis**: Analyzes the data using the `Llama70b` model by default. Customizing metrics is straightforwardâ€”see the [documentation here]() for prompt modification instructions.
7. **Data Export**: Exports the analyzed data metrics to a CSV file for further analysis.

### Integration

Omniscient is integrated into the [ESC Velocity]() project, enhancing the insights provided by Omniscient. Visit the ESC Velocity project page for more information and additional features.
